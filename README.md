## Introduction
The most impressive websites in the world use 3D graphics and animations to bring their content to life. In This Project , I build My own ThreeJS 3D Developer Portfolio today! 
 
In this Project ,I used the following:
- ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model 
- React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
- TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
- Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring my React website to life with animations

##I also practiced how to:
- Load, create and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
- Make My code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices
- Implement sending emails through a form on the website
- Ensure responsiveness across all devices and improve My site's performance using Suspense and Preload.
